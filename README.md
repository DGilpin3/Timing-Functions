# Week 2 Lab: CSS Animations & Transitions 🎬

## 📖 Scenario and Summary
The goal of this lab is to practice using **CSS animations** and **CSS transitions** with timing functions to accomplish typical actions consistent with modern user interfaces.  

You will:
- Create two mouse hover effects using CSS transitions.  
- Design two additional custom hover effects of your own.  
- Build a realistic bouncing ball animation that simulates gravity using a **cubic-bezier timing function**.  

This lab builds foundational skills in web animation using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.

## 🖼️ Lab Deliverables

### Hover Effects (Transitions)
1. **Effect 1**: On hover, rotate 145° on the X-axis (duration: 1s).  
2. **Effect 2**: On hover, rotate 225° on the Z-axis and scale to 0.8 (duration: 1s).  
3. **Effect 3**: On hover, rotate 145° on the Y-axis and scale to 1.1 (duration: 0.5s).  
4. **Custom Effects**: Two additional hover effects designed by you.

### Bouncing Ball (Animation)
- A ball drops and bounces vertically.  
- Motion simulates gravity using a **cubic-bezier timing function**.  
- Infinite repetition for continuous bounce.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- **Text Editor**: Brackets, Notepad++, VS Code, or any code-aware editor  
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge  
- **Server**: Career Web Portfolio (CWP) server for uploading labs

📝 Notes
Animations use CSS keyframes with translate3d and rotate for smooth GPU-accelerated motion.

Transitions rely on the hover pseudo-class with transform properties.

The bouncing ball demonstrates squash and stretch principles from animation theory.
